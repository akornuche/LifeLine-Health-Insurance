# LifeLine-Health-Insurance

this project is still a work in progress
it is a web and app based site that will serve as health insurance for users. 
users will register and pay for whichever package they can afford
they will also be allowed to bring in maximum of 4 dependents
but thats not all

the site will pair users with doctors, hospitals and pharmacies 
where registered users will get all services free even up to surgical operations.
the medical records will be accessed by all concerned by their roles vary

with a very complex routing system, this job is resting on a vue.js frontend, node.js backend
as well as a robust PostgreSQL database. 
i will update as it progresses.
